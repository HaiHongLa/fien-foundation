          <h2>About the program</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The volunteering and Internship Program in Tanzania is a great
              opportunity for international students to get practical skills
              while experiencing immersion in a new culture.
            </li>
            <li>
              We are cooperating with our partner schools; Mjimpya, Tushikamane,
              Bungodimwe, Mafiga, SUA, and Mjimkuu provide a placement that fits
              the students' career goals. During the program, the interns/
              volunteers will have the opportunity to receive dedicated guidance
              and supervision from the program director and trained local
              professionals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conducting volunteering/ internship in Tanzania can be an
              incredibly personally and professionally rewarding experience.
              This is an attractive country to volunteers/ interns from a
              professional standpoint, because it is a country that is not yet
              popular on the classic Western map. This means that competition is
              relatively low for a variety of interesting internship
              opportunities. The volunteer/ the intern will have a unique
              experience that will certainly set him/her out above the rest. The
              volunteers/ interns are likely to gain cultural insights and
              understanding that will stand them in good stead for understanding
              people of various backgrounds, regardless of where they end up
              working in the future.
